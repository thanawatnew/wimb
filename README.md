# WIMB (Where is My bus: bus tracking system using CCTV)
This is my senior project to track buses within Bangkok, hope bangkokians find it useful.

Required library:
- apache2
- php_gd
- opencv 2.4
- opencv 3 (if you need to use a program to detect the color)
- geopy

How to use
start the program by using this command: python start_wimb.py

if you can't use grep (/bin/grep), set is_ocr variable to False
in get_image.py
